This was a one-sample proportion test of the null hypothesis that the true population proportion is equal to `r test$null.value`. Using a significance cut-off of `r alpha`, we do not reject the null hypothesis, and cannot conclude that the true population proportion is different than `r test$null.value`. The observed number of events is `r (strsplit(test$data.name, ",") %>% unlist() %>% strsplit(split = " ") %>% unlist())[1] %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",")`, out of a total sample size of `r (strsplit(test$data.name, ",") %>% unlist() %>% strsplit(split = " ") %>% unlist())[4] %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",")`.

The confidence interval for the true population proportionis (`r tidytest$conf.low`, `r tidytest$conf.high`). That is, 95 times out of 100, this interval will contain the true population proportion.

The p-value for this test is `r test$p.value`. This, formally, is defined as the probability of observing a sample proportion that is as or more extreme than the observed sample proportion, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, this is the probability of observing a sample proportion that is greater than `r test$null.value + abs(test$estimate - test$null.value)` or less than `r test$null.value - abs(test$estimate - test$null.value)` assuming the null hypothesis (that the population proportion is `r test$null.value`) were really true. A smaller p-value can be used to reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the data are not consistent with a true population proportion of `r test$null.value`. A common cutoff convention is a p-value of less than 0.05.
