```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk(echo = TRUE)
```

The `explainr` package turns R objects into easily understood plain English. For example, suppose we have a proportion test:

```{r ttest}
pt <- prop.test(2, 10, .5)
```

We could turn it into plain English with:

```{r explain1}
explain(pt)
```

In a knitr document, you might prefer to put `results = 'asis'`:

```{r explain2, results = 'asis'}
explain(pt)
```
